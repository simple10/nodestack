/*
Place vendor CSS files in this directory to be served as a static asset.
It's better to put non-minified CSS in assets/css/vendor and let
the assets pipeline manage the files.

Files in this directory are served from /css base URL.

e.g.
public/css/README.css
http://localhost:3000/css/README.css
